# Web_Blog

I'm excited about my first web app! 

It is a simple web-based blog that is developped by Flask framework and uses HTML, CSS and Bootstrap.
The blog requires MongoDB to be running without authentication enabled. Once this is running, execute the app and navigate to the endpoint (default: http://127.0.0.1:4995/).

The available endpoints are:
/

/login

/register

/blogs

/blogs/new

/posts/<string:blog_id>

/posts/new/<string:blog_id>

To be continued..
